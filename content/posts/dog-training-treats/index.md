### Training treat texture matters

**Soft chews** are excellent for quick eating, but **crunchy treats** might be better if your dog is motivated by longer chewing times.

### Calculate the right size

The treats should be small so that they do not fill your pet up and detract from their regular diet.

## Incorporating Treats into Training

Implementing treats effectively during training involves more than just handing them out. Here are a few tips to get the most out of your treat-based training sessions:

- **Consistency is Key**: Use the same treats to create a consistent positive reinforcement pattern.
- **Variable Reward Schedules**: Mix up when and how you offer treats to keep your dog guessing and engaged.
- **Non-treat rewards**: Alongside treats, use praise, pets, and play to diversify the rewards.
