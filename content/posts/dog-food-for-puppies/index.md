- **Fats:** Vital for energy and the development of the brain and eyes.
- **Calcium and Phosphorus:** Necessary for strong bone growth.

## Feeding Your Puppy: Best Practices

It’s not just about choosing the right food, but also feeding your puppy correctly to ensure optimal growth and health.

### Tips on How Much and How Often to Feed Your Puppy
1. **Follow the Feeding Guide:** Start with the recommended amount on the puppy food package and adjust as needed based on your puppy’s growth and activity level.
2. **Multiple Small Meals:** Especially for very young puppies, multiple small meals throughout the day can aid digestion and stable energy levels.
3. **Consult Your Vet:** As your puppy grows, their nutritional needs can change. Regular check-ups with your vet can help keep your puppy’s diet on the right track.

### Common FAQs About Puppy Nutrition

#### What should I do if my puppy doesn’t seem interested in their food?
Try warming the food slightly or adding a little bit of water to enhance the flavor. Always check with your vet to rule out any underlying health issues.

#### Is it okay to feed my puppy adult dog food?
Puppies should ideally be fed puppy-specific food until they reach at least 80% of their expected adult weight. This ensures they are getting the proper nutrients for growth.

#### How can I tell if my puppy is on a good diet?
A healthy diet is often visible through your puppy’s physical condition. Your puppy should have a shiny coat, clear eyes, regular bowel movements, and consistent, healthy weight gain.
