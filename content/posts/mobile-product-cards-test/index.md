# Mobile Product Card System Test

This page tests the new mobile-optimized product card layouts implemented in Task 6.

## Single Product Card Test

Testing individual product card layout and responsiveness:

{{< product id="kibble-01" >}}

## Multiple Product Cards Test

Testing multiple individual product cards (grid layout applied via CSS):

<div class="products-grid">

{{< product id="toy-01" >}}

{{< product id="litter-02" >}}

{{< product id="harness-01" >}}

</div>

## More Product Cards Test

Testing additional products to validate responsive behavior:

<div class="products-grid">

{{< product id="kibble-01" >}}

{{< product id="toy-03" >}}

{{< product id="litter-03" >}}

</div>

## Mobile Testing Notes

**Key areas to test:**

1. **Touch Targets**: All CTA buttons should be at least 48px (52px on touch devices)
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Product title, price, and rating should be clearly visible on small screens
3. **Image Responsiveness**: Product images should scale appropriately across all screen sizes
4. **Grid Responsiveness**: Products should stack to single column on mobile, expand to multiple columns on larger screens
5. **Typography**: Text should be readable at all sizes using the fluid typography system
6. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers, high contrast mode, and reduced motion preferences

**Breakpoint Testing:**
- ≤374px: Ultra-compact layout
- 375px-414px: Standard mobile phones
- 415px-480px: Large mobile phones  
- 481px-768px: Small tablets/landscape phones
- 769px-1024px: Tablets
- 1025px-1199px: Small desktops
- ≥1200px: Large desktops

**Container Query Testing:**
The product cards should adapt based on their container width, not just viewport width.
