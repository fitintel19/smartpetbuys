**Payoff:** Fewer vet bills, better health, longer life  

#### **🛡️ 2. Safety Items**

### 💵 **When to SAVE (Smart Budget Choices)**

#### **🎾 1. Toys**
**Why:** Pets often prefer simple/homemade items  
**Reality Check:** $2 cardboard box > $25 electronic toy  
**Strategy:** Buy variety packs, rotate toys, DIY options

**Why:** Basic stainless steel = same function as designer bowls  
**Sweet Spot:** $10-25 (stainless steel, non-slip base)

#### **🦴 3. Training Treats**
**Why:** Homemade can be just as effective and healthier  
**DIY Options:** Frozen carrots, plain chicken, cheese cubes  
**Budget:** $5/month homemade vs $20/month store-bought  

#### **🧽 4. Cleaning Supplies**
**Why:** Generic brands often identical to name brands  
**Strategy:** Buy enzymatic cleaners in bulk, use DIY recipes
